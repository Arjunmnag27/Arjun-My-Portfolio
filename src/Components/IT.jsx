                    HTML5 is the latest major version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
                    the standard language used to create and design web pages.
                    Released in October 2014, HTML5 introduces numerous new features and improvements that enhance the web development experience.
                    Key features of HTML5 include new semantic elements like header, footer, and article which provide better structure and meaning to web content.
                    It also introduces native support for multimedia elements with audio and video, reducing the need for third-party plugins. Additionally,
                    HTML5 incorporates improved support for web applications through the use of APIs such as the Canvas API for drawing graphics, the Geolocation API for location-based services,
                    and the Web Storage API for client-side data storage. These advancements make HTML5 a powerful tool for creating modern, interactive, and responsive websites.

                    JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactive behavior to web pages.
                    It allows developers to create dynamic content, handle user events, validate forms,
                    and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) for real-time updates without reloading the page.
                    JavaScript is essential for front-end development but also widely used in back-end environments like Node.js.
                    It supports object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming, making it highly flexible for creating web applications,
                    APIs, games, and even server-side logic.

                    React.js is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of developers.
                    It is used to build user interfaces, especially for single-page applications.
                    React allows developers to create reusable components, making it easier to manage large applications.
                    One of its main features is the virtual DOM, which improves performance by updating only the parts of
                    a web page that change, instead of reloading the entire page. React is widely used for building modern
                    web and mobile applications, and it supports tools like hooks for managing state and component lifecycle.
